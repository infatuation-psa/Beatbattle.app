## abstract
a host selects a sample (or group of samples, aka, a 'pack') to be distributed to battle participants. when a battle begins, participants download the sample or pack, and race to create the best beat they can under a time limit set by the host. the time between the battle starting and the time limit expiring is the open period in a battle. when users complete their beat, they upload their file as a submission to the battle. when the open period concludes, participants and the public are able to listen to all of the submissions to the battle and vote to determine the battle's winner. this voting happens duing the voting period, where submissions are displayed in a numbered list. each participant is shown submissions in a random order, and cannot vote for themselves. it is common practice for the host to require at least one vote from each participant to qualify that participant's entry to win the battle. at the end of the voting period, the voting results are displayed and the victor is revealed.
